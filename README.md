# My Travel Book

Our lives are a book and each travel and each journey are a story. Each trip we made is a chapter made of pages full of tails.

With My Travel Book it's super easy to tell those tails and share them with our family, friends and the entire world.

Create your own unique book and fill it with stories about your travels journeys and short trips.

## This is how it works:

Book ==> Chapters ==> Pages

Each user can create one book.
A book can contain any number of chapters.
Each chapter is a different travel, made of pages that tells the tail of a specific day or the entire journey, it's up to you to decide how you want to tell your story.

You can add, per chapter, locations to be displayed on a map and images for a photo album for each travel,
so that they could help you remember or even just to show your fiends and family exactly where you've been.
